SwiftSweep is a CLI tool designed to eliminate all node_modules directories across designated project paths, achieving a significant reduction in local storage consumption and optimizing system performance. For developers working on multiple Node.js projects, node_modules directories can quickly accumulate and take up valuable disk space, slowing down system performance and cluttering storage.

SwiftSweep automates the process by scanning specified project directories and identifying every instance of node_modules. With a single command, users can clear all detected directories, freeing up storage without the hassle of manual deletion. This results in a leaner file structure, faster file indexing, and a smoother, more efficient system.
